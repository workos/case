# Context: Pipeline Glossary

Canonical vocabulary for the case pipeline. Every term used in code, specs, and docs should match these definitions. When a new term is introduced, add it here first.

## Terms

| Term | Definition | Rejected Alternatives |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **task** | A unit of agent work dispatched by the pipeline. Has a `taskId`, status, and associated event log. | `job`, `run` (too generic) |
| **phase** | A named pipeline stage that produces one `AgentResult`. One of: implement, verify, review, approve, close, retrospective. | `step` (too generic), `stage` (ambiguous with CI) |
| **node** | A DAG vertex representing one phase execution at a specific revision cycle. E.g., `implement_0`, `verify_1`. Introduced in Phase 3. | `vertex` (too academic) |
| **status** | The lifecycle position of a task, derived from pipeline state. One of: active, implementing, verifying, reviewing, evaluating, closing, pr-opened, merged. | `state` (reserved for `PipelineState`, the full reconstructible object) |
| **state** | The full reconstructible pipeline state object (`PipelineState`), produced by `reduceEvents()`. | `snapshot` (used in mill for a different concept) |
| **event** | An immutable past-tense fact appended to the event log. Events are the source of truth. | `action`, `command` (those are imperative; events are facts) |
| **projection** | A derived view computed from `PipelineState`. Examples: `TaskJson`, `RunMetrics`, evidence markers. | `view`, `derivation` |
| **runtime** | The `CaseAgentRuntime` interface that abstracts agent spawn/cancel/tool-creation. | `provider` (that's the backing service, not the interface) |
| **adapter** | A concrete implementation of `CaseAgentRuntime` for a specific provider. E.g., `PiRuntimeAdapter`. | `driver`, `connector` |
| **evaluator** | Collective term for verifier and reviewer — the two phases that assess implementation quality. | `assessor`, `checker` |
| **marker** | A file written to `.case/<task-slug>/` as evidence of a completed phase. E.g., `tested`, `reviewed`. | `flag`, `sentinel` |
| **evidence** | Proof that a phase completed successfully. Includes marker files, SHA-256 hashed test output, screenshots. | `artifact` (too broad) |

## Rejected Names

Names considered and explicitly rejected, with rationale. Prevents re-litigating settled decisions.

| Rejected Name | Context | Why Rejected |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| `job` | Alternative for "task" | Too generic — conflates with CI jobs, cron jobs |
| `run` | Alternative for "task" | Too generic — conflicts with "pipeline run" (a run executes a task) |
| `step` | Alternative for "phase" | Too generic — could mean anything sequential |
| `stage` | Alternative for "phase" | Ambiguous with CI stages (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) |
| `vertex` | Alternative for "node" | Too academic — DAG is already abstract enough |
| `state` (for status) | Alternative for "status" | Reserved for `PipelineState` — the full reconstructible object, not a scalar position |
| `snapshot` | Alternative for "state" | Used in mill for a different concept (point-in-time capture) |
| `action` / `command` | Alternative for "event" | Those are imperative; events are past-tense facts |
| `view` / `derivation` | Alternative for "projection" | Too vague — "projection" is precise: state → derived output |
| `provider` | Alternative for "runtime" | That's the backing service (e.g., Pi), not the interface |
| `driver` / `connector` | Alternative for "adapter" | Too database-y — adapter is the standard GoF pattern name |
| `assessor` / `checker` | Alternative for "evaluator" | Too vague — evaluator implies structured judgment (rubric) |
| `flag` / `sentinel` | Alternative for "marker" | Flag implies boolean toggle; sentinel implies guarding. Markers are evidence artifacts. |
| `artifact` | Alternative for "evidence" | Too broad — artifacts include logs, traces, plans. Evidence specifically proves completion. |
